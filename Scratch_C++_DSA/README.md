# Advance C++

Collection of advanced C++ data structures and algorithm solutions.

This repository contains practice problems and implementations under the `Scratch_C++_DSA` folder.

Notes:
- `Scratch_C++_DSA` is tracked as a normal folder (not a submodule).
- Compiled binaries (`*.exe`) are ignored via `.gitignore`.

How to run / build
- Use your preferred C++ compiler (g++, clang++) to build individual files. This repo doesn't include a global build system.

Contributing
- Add solutions under `Scratch_C++_DSA/Array` or create new folders for other topics.
- Avoid committing compiled binaries; add a small README or `.gitkeep` to preserve empty folders if needed.

License
- Add a license file if you want to open-source this repository.
